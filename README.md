# Choose Your Own Adventure
My first Python project. A choose your own adventure game! Dare to play?

# Storyboard
## Exposition
Story opens up at the beginning of a trail head. It is starting to get dark but it's only a 3 mile hike, do you turn and do home? Of course not! You start your trek, nearly 2 miles in you see a way that goes off trail. Do you explore or stay enroute? If you choose to explore then you are in for a treat. At the end of the off trail path you find a riverfront home with a small fishing dock. Do you knock to see if someone is home or do you just assume no one is home? Well no answer but your choice does affect your future..

## Conflict
Inside the house you see cobwebs and old memorabilia
